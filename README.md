# File-Encryption-Decryption-Using-Java
A simple system to encrypt and decrypt files using java
You can encrypt three types of data using this system - Plain Text, Text Files (pdf,word,xml,etc) and Media Files (jpg,png,mp4)
I have used three algorithms namely - 
Caesar Cipher Algorithm for Plain Text
Data Encryption Standard (DES) for Text Files
Blowfish Algorithm for Media Files

Download all the three files and make sure to edit the path to the files you want to encrypt in the respective code files.
